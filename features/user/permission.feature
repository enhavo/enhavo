Feature: Admin Login
    In order to log into admin
    As a user with no admin permission
    I want to see a error message

    Background:
        Given following users
            | username          | email             | password | roles      |
            | peter@enhavo.com  | peter@enhavo.com  | peter    | ROLE_USER  |
        Given I clear cookies

    @web
    Scenario: Log in with missing permission
        Given I am on "/admin/login"
        And I wait for "[name=_email]"
        And I fill in "_email" with "peter@enhavo.com"
        And I fill in "_password" with "peter"
        And I press "#_submit"
        Then I should be on "/admin/login"
