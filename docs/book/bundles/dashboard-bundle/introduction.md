## Introduction

With the `DashboardBundle` you can create a dashboard. The dashboard
provides an overview of all relevant information at one glance. To
accomplish this, different widgets are used. The default widget type is
`number`. It shows, for example, the total amount of articles written,
or only the amount of published articles.

To retrieve the right value, providers are used. To get a total number,
use the `total` provider. If you want to use your own repository method,
use the `repository` provider instead.

You have complete freedom by writing your own widgets and providers.
