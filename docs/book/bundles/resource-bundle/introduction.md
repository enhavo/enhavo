## Introduction

The resource bundle is a very important bundle in the enhavo eco system. 
It's responsible to register resources and defining grids and input masks
and provides a handful of useful functions and workflows, helping you to handle your business model and data.

The resource bundle is completely headless and don't serve any assets. 
It's build to serve CRUD features and keep all customizable.
If you have any requirements which the bundle does not provide, we have a solid api
to easily add your own features.

This bundle is heavily inspired by the sylius resource bundle, but uses the typical [enhavo type pattern](/book/components/type/index)
