## Type Pattern

The `Type Pattern` is a behavioral pattern which is widely used in
enhavo. It is not an official pattern like the ones from Gang of Four, which you
probably know. While developing enhavo, we realized that we need an
abstract workflow to convert configurations directly into php classes.
So over time we found this pattern in our code and standardized it.

For developers who use enhavo as a normal CMS, it is not important to
understand this pattern in detail, but the more you work with enhavo,
the more interesting it will be for you.

The goal of this pattern is to create objects with an encapsulated
configuration and different behaviours - but using the same api.

Think of different actions or buttons which can be configured easily in
a yaml file like this:

```yaml
create:
    type: create
save:
    type: save
    route: my_save_route
delete:
    type: delete
    label: My custom delete label
    icon: trash
```

The simplest configuration for a type is just the type option itself.
When creating the type we handle the options with the Symfony
`OptionResolver`. It allows you to set the possible options, and also
the defaults and required options.

Later on you want a object with the same api to handle your actions, but
you don\'t have to take care about how this object is configured inside.

```php
<?php

    $actions = $manager->getActions($configuration);
    $viewData = [];
    foreach($actions as $action) {
        $viewData[$action->getKey()] = $action->createViewData($resource);
    }
```

As a user of actions you don\'t want to deal with `OptionResolver`, this
logic should be encapsulated inside the action. The assembly of the view
data is delegated to the type. After you get the actions from the
manager, you don\'t need the configuration anymore.

```php
<?php
    class SaveActionType extends ActionTypeInterface
    {
        public function createViewData(array $options, $resource = null)
        {
            return [
                'label' => $options['label'],
                'icon' => $options['icon'],
                'url' => $this->router->generate($options['route']);
            ];
        }

        public function configureOptions(OptionsResolver $resolver)
        {
            $resolver->setDefaults([
                'label' => 'Save'
                'icon' => 'disk',
            ])
            $resolver->setRequired('route');
        }
    }
```

Thanks to the symfony dependency injection container we can add this
type to the central repository by tagging, and it will only be
instantiated if it is really used.

The following UML shows the classes involved in the `Type Pattern`.
