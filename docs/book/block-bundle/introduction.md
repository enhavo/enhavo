## Introduction

With the `BlockBundle` you can use blocks to create your content dynamic
over the admin. Blocks can be nested and therefore they are a very
powerfully feature to create grid layouts. Default blocks are
`one_column`, `two_column`, `text` or `text_picture`. But you could add
any block you want.
