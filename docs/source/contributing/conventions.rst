Route name
----------

- Don't use camel case, use underscore instead

For example you have a bundle called ``enhavoAppBundle``, and a action
called ``index`` then you have to name your route like this ``enhavo_app_index``.
A route should contain the following information divide by an underscore:

1) Company name

2) Bundle name

3) Entity name (optional)

4) Action name


Bundle
------

- One menu is one app

- One app should be one Bundle

- Only in the Project Bundle you can add more then one app
