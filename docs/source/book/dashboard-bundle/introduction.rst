Introduction
============

With the ``DashboardBundle`` you can create a dashboard. The dashboard provides an overview of all relevant information at one glance.
To accomplish this, different widgets are used.
The default widget type is ``number``. It shows, for example, the total amount of articles written, or only the amount of published articles.

To retrieve the right value, providers are used. To get a total number, use the ``total`` provider. If you want to use your own repository method, use the ``repository`` provider instead.

You have complete freedom by writing your own widgets and providers.
