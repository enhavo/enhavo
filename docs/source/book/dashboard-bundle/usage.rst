Configuration
-------------------

In the following you see an example on how widgets are configured in enhavo:

.. code-block:: yaml

    enhavo_dashboard:
        widgets:
            article_number:
                type: number
                label: Total Articles
                provider:
                    type: total
                    repository: enhavo_article.repository.article

In the example above, the widget key is ``article_number``. The widget type is ``number`` (you could use any other widget type as well).
You can configure the label shown with the ``label`` attribute.

To configure the provider, add the type and all necessary options.

See all possible options in our reference.
