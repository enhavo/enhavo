Entity resolver
===============

The entity resolver is a service to resolve a entity object to a name and
on the other hand you can pass the name with an id to receive this entity again.

.. code-block:: php

    interface EntityResolverInterface
    {
        public function getName(object $entity): string;

        public function getEntity(int $id, string $name): ?object;
    }

Why that is useful? In some cases you need to save the relation to an entity. But you
can't serialize it, because this entity might been updated.

To facing that problem you can just save the name and the id of that entity a retrieve it later by the entity resolver.

The entity name could simple the class name. But we also use sylius and therefor the entity class might change because
of an update of the software. So it is useful to save an alias for this entity. The entity resolver again will take care
of that.

How to use
----------

To use the entity resolver, just inject the service ``Enhavo\Bundle\DoctrineExtensionBundle\EntityResolver\EntityResolverInterface``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    services:
        my_service:
            arguments:
                - '@Enhavo\Bundle\DoctrineExtensionBundle\EntityResolver\EntityResolverInterface'
