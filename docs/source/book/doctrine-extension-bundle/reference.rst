Polymorphism
------------

Imagine you have a model class that refers to an other class by just knowing it's interface and not
the concrete implementation. Of course that's a very common use case in object orientated programming.

.. figure:: /_static/image/polymorph-example.png

    Here you can see a simple page class, that contains blocks like a text or a picture.

But if you want to translate this polymorphism into a relational database like mysql,
it's not so clear how your table structure will look like.

Normally we are not interested how the sql schema will end up, because we use doctrine as our ORM layer which
should take care of it. But in doctrine, we are not able to configure this out of the box. We need some help
by extensions. Enhavo has it's own extension for that use case.

Implementations
---------------

In general, we have two obvious sql implementations with pros and cons. Let's have look at the page table.

.. code::

 +----+---------------+------------------+
 | id | text_block_id | picture_block_id |
 +----+---------------+------------------+
 | 1  | 1             | NULL             |
 +----+---------------+------------------+
 | 2  | NULL          | 1                |
 +----+---------------+------------------+

With this structure we can use sql foreign key constraints, because one column is a reference to one specific table.
This also gives us the option to use delete cascades. But if we add more and more blocks, the table is growing
by adding a new column for each block we add.

Further, if we have a look to the php implementation, doctrine translates each column to a class property.
As a result, to encapsulate the data model we need to use if or switch statements for each block.

.. code-block:: php

    class Page
    {
        private $textBlock;
        private $pictureBlock;

        public function setBlock(BlockInterface $block)
        {
            if($block instanceof TextBlock) {
                $this->textBlock = $block;
            } elseif($block instanceof PictureBlock) {
                $this->pictureBlock = $block;
            }
        }
    }

This is an anti-pattern, because it violates the open close principle ("Open for extensions and close
for modifications"). But we need to edit this file every time we want to add a block.

So let's have a look at the other possible implementation.

.. code::

 +----+--------------+----------+
 | id | block_class  | block_id |
 +----+--------------+----------+
 | 1  | TextBlock    | 1        |
 +----+--------------+----------+
 | 2  | PictureBlock | 1        |
 +----+--------------+----------+

With this structure we don't need any further columns for blocks we add. We just need to inform someone that a TextBlock
will resolve to an sql look up on the TextBlock table, which is a easy feature in doctrine.

On the other hand, we lose some sql features like foreign keys and thus delete constraints. This is a risk for inconsistent
data. In some cases we can help ourselves by creating a reference from the inverse block tables back to the page table.

And how does our php code look like? Well, it's strait forward. We just implement the common polymorphism.

.. code-block:: php

    class Page
    {
        private $block;
        private $blockClass;
        private $blockId;

        public function setBlock(BlockInterface $block)
        {
            $this->block = $block;
        }
    }


Configuration
-------------

To make it work, the ``EnhavoDoctrineExtensionBundle`` will hooks into doctrine
and takes care of resolving ``$blockClass`` and ``$blockId``, and injects the correct
block if you got the object from a repository.

For that you have to add some ORM mapping to your entity like in this example.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace App\Entity

    use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

    /**
     * @ORM\Entity
     */
    class Page
    {
        /** @var BlockInterface */
        private $block;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="string", length=255, nullable=true)
         */
        private $blockClass;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="integer",  nullable=true)
         */
        private $blockId;

        public function setBlock(BlockInterface $block)
        {
            $this->block = $block;
        }
    }


Now tell the ``EnhavoDoctrineExtensionBundle`` for which class you want to add the reference behavior and which field
the listener has to observe.

.. code:: yaml

    enhavo_doctrine_extension:
        metadata:
            App/Entity/Page:
                reference:
                    block:
                        idField: blockId
                        nameField: blockClass

That's all. The ``EnhavoDoctrineExtensionBundle`` takes care of ``App/Entity/Page``
