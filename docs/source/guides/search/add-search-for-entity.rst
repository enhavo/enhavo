========================

To make an entity searchable, just create a search.yml for your entity. Put the search.yml into ``AcmeBundle/Resource/config``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    Acme\AcmeBundle\Entity\Acme:
        properties:
            title:
                - Plain:
                    weight: 10
                    type: title
            text:
                - Html:
                    type: text
                    weights:
                      h1: 12
                      h2: 10
                      p: 7
            tag:
                - Collection:
                    - Plain:
                        weight: 3
                        type: tag
            category:
                - Collection:
                    entity: Enhavo\Bundle\CategoryBundle\Entity\Category
            grid:
                - Model

Under `properties` you can define the fields of your entity that should be indexed.
Under each field you tell the search engine what kind of content is in the current field.
If you have just a plain text you choose ``Plain`` field:

.. code-block:: yaml

    title:
        - Plain:
            weight: 10
            type: title

If there is a HTML text which contains HTML-tags, you should choose the ``Html`` field.

.. code-block:: yaml

    text:
        - Html:
            type: text
            weights:
              h1: 12
              h2: 10
              p: 7

With the `type` you can set the type as which the field gets stored in the database and with the `weight` you choose the weight of the field compared to all the other fields.
If you have the `Html` field you can give weights to each HTML-tag (if you just skip the `weights` there are default weights for the HTML-tags).

Attention: If you use elastic-search you can not define the weight for each HTML-tag. Just use the weight like explained for the `Plain` type.

If your field is a ``Collection``, you can choose between to types.

.. code-block:: yaml

    tag:
        - Collection:
            - Plain:
                weight: 3
                type: tag
    category:
        - Collection:
            entity: Enhavo\Bundle\CategoryBundle\Entity\Category

The first type means that the collection are just fiels of type text or HTML.
The second one means that your collection consists of an other entity. In this case the other entity has to have a search.yml, too.

The last field is a ``Model``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    grid:
        - Model

In this case the search engine takes the class of the given field and looks for the search.yml in belonging bundle.
This assumes that the bundle has a own search.yml.
