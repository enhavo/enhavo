Overwrite application service
=============================

In some cases you want to add your own logic or replace the default one. If this logic is in a service that is loaded
by the application, you can just overwrite this service and change it to your needs. Just follow these steps.

Create service
--------------

Create your own service and extend from the old one

.. code:: typescript

    // assets/enhavo/lib/MyView.ts

    import View from '@enhavo/app/View';

    export default class MyView extends View
    {
        // ... overwrite or add function
    }


Create application
------------------

Create your application class and extend from the old. Just replace the services you want by overwriting the parent methods.

.. code:: typescript

    // assets/enhavo/lib/MyApplication.ts

    import Application from "@enhavo/app/Application";
    import MyView from "./MyView"

    export default class MyApplication extends Application
    {
        public getView()
        {
            if(this.view == null) {
                this.view = new MyView(this.getDataLoader().load()['view']);
                this.view.setEventDispatcher(this.getEventDispatcher());
            }
            return this.view;
        }
    }


Use application
---------------

Replace your the default application with your own one by changing the import statement

.. code:: typescript

    // assets/enhavo/view.ts

    import Application from "./lib/MyApplication";
