Dynamic routing
===============

The ``EnhavoRoutingBundle`` is used to add optional dynamic routing for the resources, so user are able to enter
their own url. If you want to generate a url path and the static routing can't fit your needs (e.g. nested paths) you may go for dynamic routing as well.

This following example will show you how to add a url field to your entity and how you map it to a controller action.

Relation
--------

First we need to tell our application that an entity has a ``oneToOne`` relation to a route.

.. code-block:: yaml

    oneToOne:
        route:
            cascade: ['persist', 'refresh', 'remove']
            targetEntity: Enhavo\Bundle\RoutingBundle\Model\RouteInterface
            joinColumn:
                onDelete: CASCADE

Or if you use annotations

.. code-block:: php

    /**
     * @var RouteInterface
     *
     * @ORM\OneToOne (targetEntity="Enhavo\Bundle\RoutingBundle\Model\RouteInterface", cascade={"persist", "remove", "refresh"})
     * @ORM\JoinColumn (onDelete="CASCADE")
     */
    private $route;


Implement the ``Routeable`` interface for your class.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Enhavo\Bundle\RoutingBundle\Model\Routeable;
    use Enhavo\Bundle\RoutingBundle\Model\RouteInterface;

    class Page implements Routeable
    {

        /**
         * @var RouteInterface
         */
        private $route;

        /**
         * @return RouteInterface
         */
        public function getRoute()
        {
            return $this->route;
        }

        /**
         * @param RouteInterface $route
         */
        public function setRoute(RouteInterface $route)
        {
            $this->route = $route;
        }

        //...
    }

Form
----

To add an url field in our form we just use the ``RouteType``.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Enhavo\Bundle\RoutingBundle\Form\Type\RouteType;

    // ...

    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder->add('route', RouteType::class);

        // ...
    }

If you render your form manually, you shouln't forget to add it in your template file.

.. code-block:: twig

    {{ form_row(form.route) }}

If you use the form in the enhavo admin, no further steps are required, because enhavo will take care to call the ``Generator``
and routines to update the route properly.

Controller
----------

And last but not least, we have to define our controller, and add some
mapping information to the ``SymfonyCMF RoutingBundle`` which is used by the ``EnhavoRoutingBundle``.
The mapping contains the class name of our entity and the controller action which should be called.

.. code-block:: yaml

    cmf_routing:
        dynamic:
            controllers_by_class:
                App\Entity\Page: App\Controller\PageController:showAction

Add the action to your controller. The parameter must named ``$contentDocument`` and will be your entity.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    class PageController
    {
        public function showAction(Page $contentDocument)
        {
            return $this->render('page/show.html.twig', [
                'page' => $contentDocument
            ]);
        }
    }


Add controller information to route
-----------------------------------

Like in static routes, it is also possible to save the linked controller to the route itself.
You can write a ``Generator`` and store the information

.. code-block:: php

    $page->getRoute()->setDefaults([
        '_controller' => 'App\Controller\PageController:showAction'
    ])
