Generate url on save
====================

You can also generate a url on save with the ``EnhavoRoutingBundle``. To do so, you need to make your entity
ready for dynamic routing and add meta informations for the generation in your config.

.. code-block:: yaml

    enhavo_routing:
        classes:
            Enhavo\Bundle\ArticleBundle\Entity\Article:
                generators:
                    slug:
                        type: slug
                        property: title
