Extend from resource
====================

Sometime you wan't add more properties to an enhavo entity. This is simple done by some configuration.
But first of all you have to extend the class.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace App\Entity;

    use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

    /**
     * @ORM\Entity
     */
    class Page extends Enhavo\Bundle\PageBundle\Entity\Page
    {
        // .. add your properties and mapping information
    }

Extend doctrine
---------------

Now you have to add mapping information to the ``EnhavoDoctrineExtensionBundle``

.. code-block:: yaml

    enhavo_doctrine_extension:
        metadata:
            App\Entity\Page:
                extends: Enhavo\Bundle\PageBundle\Entity\Page
                discrName: 'app'


Change Resource
---------------

If the entity you want to extend is a sylius resource (Check it it implements the ``ResourceInterface``). Then you also
have to change the model configuration. If it's not a sylius resource you can skip this step.

.. code-block:: yaml

    enhavo_page:
        resources:
            page:
                classes:
                    model: App\Entity\Page

Update doctrine interface
-------------------------

In some cases you also have to update the interface information in doctrine. This is needed for other entities that
will refer to your extended entity.

.. code-block:: yaml

    doctrine:
        orm:
            resolve_target_entities:
                Enhavo\Bundle\PageBundle\Model\PageInterface: App\Entity\Page
